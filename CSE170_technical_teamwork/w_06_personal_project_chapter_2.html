        <h1>My Style</h1> 
        <h5 class="w3-padding-15">•	My style is to create game plans. The first thing I do when I find out that I have to make an important decision is come up with a game plan. I think of multiple angles to approach the situation. When it comes to hosting a social gathering of any sort, I come up with a game plan to make it the least bit stressful and to use my resources to their fullest.</h5>
        
        <h1 class="w3-text-grey"> What I Value</h1>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">• I value relationships. My very best friend, Dallin Tavenner, once told me that the most important thing in our lives are our relationships. I agree with him 100 percent. We both love talking about the gospel, and it’s the gospel of Jesus Christ that has helped us come to that realization. One relationship that I especially value is my relationship with my mother. She is very precious to me, because she taught me the values that I have today.</p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">• Another thing that I value is the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I’ve learned so much from it every day, and everything I learn from it adds value to my life.</p>
        
        <h1>What I Don’t Have Patience For</h1> 
        <h5 class="w3-padding-15">•	I don’t have patience for people that purposefully try to make a fool out of others. Whether a person is trying to make me feel like a fool or if they’re trying to make someone else feel like a fool, that boils my blood. People that do this aren’t healthy to be around, and I never enjoy being near them. </h5>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-15">•	Another thing that I don’t have patience for is people that belittle others. No one is more important than anyone else. By living the Gospel of Jesus Christ, I’ve come to learn and believe that none of us are better than any of our brothers or sisters.</h5>

        <h1 class="w3-text-grey"> The Best Way to Communicate with Me</h1>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">• My most preferred method of communication is face to face. I feel like that is the most genuine way to communicate. Body language is huge for me. It’s hard for me to completely understand a person’s intentions over text or phone call. If I had to rate my most preferred methods of communication from best to worst, then it would be: 1- Face-to-Face, 2- Video Call, 3- Phone Call, 4- Text, 5- Email.</p>
        
        <h1>How to Help Me</h1> 
        <h5 class="w3-padding-15">•	I tend to let people know when I am struggling. I wear my heart on my sleeve. You will know when I need help. Whether it be emotional support or technical support, you will know. The best way to go about it is to calm me down, affirm that everything will be alright, and to help me come up with a game plan.</h5>
        
        <h1 class="w3-text-grey"> What People Misunderstand About Me</h1>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">•	What people misunderstand about me is that I don’t want to spend time with them. I love spending time with friends, acquaintances, classmates, and co-workers. I sometimes don’t show the desire to be around others too well, because I’m afraid of rejection. Completely excluding romantic rejection, plutonic rejection still hurts. The fear of missing out stems from that.</p>

        <h1>Health, Work, Play, and Love Dashboard</h1> 
        <h2>Format: Define, Measure, Analysis, Summary</h2>
        <h4>•	Health</h4>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-15">-	“Health” for me covers mental well-being, physical well-being, and spiritual well-being. My mental well-being is at a ¾. My physical well-being is at a ½. My spiritual well-being is at a ¾. I rated my mental well-being at a ¾, because I’ve been working on fortifying my emotional resilience. I rated my physical well-being at a ½, because I used to go to the gym every day, but I’ve been slacking. I also used to wake up at 6:30 in the morning every day, but I’ve been sleeping in lately. I’ve rated my spiritual well-being at a ¾, because I feel like I’ve improved a lot this year, but I still have a lot more to work on.</h5>
       
        <h4>•	Work</h4>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-15">-	“Work” for me covers how I balance my academic responsibilities and my part-time job at Squeeze Media. I would rate my ability to balance my academic responsibilities at a ½. I’d rate my work balance at a ¾. I rated my ability to balance my academic responsibilities at a half, because I typically submit assignments close to the due date. I also had to submit some assignments (like this one), because I didn’t know how to submit them properly.</h5>

        <h4>•	Play</h4>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-15">-	“Play” for me covers hanging out with friends, playing video games, and anything that I find fun to do. I’d rate my play at a ¾. The reason why is because I know what makes me relax. I know what I enjoy. It’s not a perfect FULL, because sometimes I play when I should be working instead. It doesn’t happen too often though.</h5>

        <h4>•	Love</h4>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-15">-	“Love” for me covers two things. My dating life, and my family/friendships. My dating life is at a ½. My family/friendships are at a FULL. My dating life is at a ½, because I haven’t found my other half yet. 😉 Haha. Seriously though, I feel like my dating life is at a ½, because I put in effort, but I probably should be putting in more effort. I rated my family/friendships at a FULL, because I feel like my relationships with my family and my friends are doing absolutely amazing.</h5>

        <h1 class="w3-text-grey">Workview and Lifeview Compass</h1>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">• Workview</p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">-	Work to me is a skill. It’s something that is learned. Why do we work? We work, because it’s in our DNA. It’s what we must do to survive. Work is for everyone and it is for their survival. Work to an individual is typically something they do to get compensation. Work to others is something that someone else does for a purpose. Work to society is a necessary component of a healthy and working society. Money is just man’s way of compensating work. Money only has value, because man agreed that it has value. Experience helps work become easier. Growth is a motivating factor of seeking more challenging forms of work. Fulfillment stems from the very depths of our DNA. Fulfillment of work exists to encourage man to work to survive.</p>
        
        <p class="w3-text-grey">• Lifeview</p>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">-	My lifeview has been greatly affected by my spiritual experiences, physical experiences, and emotional experiences. I was a member of the Roman Catholic Faith for the first 18 years of my life. Those experiences made me think that life was kind of meaningless, and that life only mattered during my time here on Earth. However, since learning about the Gospel of Jesus Christ and His restored church, my lifeview has changed dramatically. I now view my life as a ladder. It keeps getting better and higher. I keep climbing higher to greater knowledge and greater happiness. My physical experiences has taught me that life is fragile. You need to be careful with any form of life. Plants, animals, and people are fragile. My emotional experiences have affected my lifeview the most. I truly appreciate genuine people, I seek to be genuine, and I celebrate relationships, family, and friendships.</p>

        <h1>Odyssey Plans</h1> 
        <h5 class="w3-padding-15">
          •	Plan A (Most Realistic)
          <ul>Year 0: Continue Studying at Brigham Young University – Idaho while working part-time.</ul>
          <ul>Year 1: Graduate Brigham Young University – Idaho.</ul>
          <ul>Year 2-5: Work as a software engineer or programmer for a company in Colorado, Arizona, or Texas.</ul>
          Plan A (Most Realistic) questions: 
          Can you graduate sooner, or will it take at least 1 year? 
          Do you need to work part time?
          How likely can you quit your job, pick up more credits per semester, and graduate sooner?
          <ul>- Plan A (Most Realistic) Measurements:</ul>
          <ul>80% chance of this happening.</ul>
          <ul>Resources: BYU-I Faculty, graduate friends, parents, already learned computer skills, networking efforts.</ul>
          <ul>Likability: Excited & looking forward to it.</ul>
          <ul>Confidence: Attainable & realistic.</ul>
          <ul>Coherence: This plan makes the most sense, and it matches my workview well. </ul>

          •	Plan B (Back Up)
          <ul>Year 0: Continue Studying at Brigham Young University – Idaho while working part-time. (No different from Plan A.)</ul>
          <ul>Year 1: Graduate Brigham Young University – Idaho with a minor in marketing.</ul>
          <ul>Year 2-5: Get hired as a SEO marketer or a social media marketer.</ul>
          Plan B (Back Up) questions:  
          What are the drawbacks of minoring in marketing?
          Could you finish school while working part-time or full-time? 
          How likely can you quit your job, pick up more credits per semester, and graduate sooner? (Same as Plan A).

          <ul>- Plan B (Back Up) Measurements:</ul>
          <ul>15% chance of this happening.</ul>
          <ul>Resources: BYU-I Faculty, graduate friends, parents, already learned marketing and computer skills, networking efforts. (Mostly the same as Plan A).</ul>
          <ul>Likability: This would be a fun back up plan.</ul>
          <ul>Confidence: Just as attainable & realistic as Plan A.</ul>
          <ul>Coherence: Since marketing is my minor, this backup plan is already in motion. </ul>

          •	Plan Unlimited
          <ul>Year 0: Continue Studying at Brigham Young University – Idaho while working part-time. (No different from Plan A or B.)</ul>
          <ul>Year 1: Graduate Brigham Young University – Idaho.</ul>
          <ul>Year 2-5: Move wherever I want after finishing my degree. Maybe I’d move to the Philippines.</ul>
          Plan Unlimited questions:  
          If money isn’t an object, then why won’t you go to a more expensive place than the Philippines?
          What job would you want to have if you had unlimited money?
          Would you want to benefit the human race, or would you be selfish?
          
          <ul>- Plan Unlimited Measurements:</ul>
          <ul>5% chance of this happening. Honestly, probably less than 1% now that I think about it.</ul>
          <ul>Resources: Friends, Family in the Philippines, the internet.</ul>
          <ul>Likability: I would loooove to have this plan become a reality.</ul>
          <ul>Confidence: This will probably never happen, haha.</ul>
          <ul>Coherence: The only way that this would happen is if I won the lottery.</ul>
