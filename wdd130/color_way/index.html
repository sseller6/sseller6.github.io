        <p>Welcome to Color Way! This is the place where we'll show you the way :)</p>

            Extrovert & Introvert Skin-Tone Colors INTRO Not all people know that some colors look better on them than other colors. This could be because of their skin tone or hair color. 
            Some people also just don’t know what colors match well when it comes to clothing. Sometimes, it’s better to wear matching colors, and sometimes it’s better to purposely wear unmatching colors. 
            It depends on a few different things. It can depend on the person’s skin tone, their hair color, the person’s style, or even their make up. INTRO/ FRIENDS I was once someone like that. Thankfully, 
            I had some good friends & co-workers that taught me more about fasion sense. This website will focus on the color aspect of outfits. Colors can communicate so much! Just like a picture can contain a thousand words, 
            color can contain so much about a person’s personality. INTRO/EXAMPLE - Extrovert vs Introvert For example, vibrant colors can reflect a person’s energetic & bubbly attitude. However, a heavily introverted person might give off the wrong signal by wearing vibrant colors. 
            More calming and relaxing colors might work better for an introverted person instead. Every situation is different, and we’re here to help you find out what works best for you! COMMON QUESTIONS: Some questions that we hope to answer for our users are: 
            What colors look good on me? What colors work with what I have? What colors do I need to go out and buy? Will these colors work in a professional setting? Will these colors make me stand out, or will they help me to blend in?
