        Extrovert & Introvert 

Skin-Tone 

Colors 


INTRO 

Not all people know that some colors look better on them than other colors. This could be because of their skin tone or hair color. Some people also just don’t know what colors match well when it comes to clothing. Sometimes, it’s better to wear matching colors, and sometimes it’s better to purposely wear unmatching colors. It depends on a few different things. It can depend on the person’s skin tone, their hair color, the person’s style, or even their make up.  

INTRO/ FRIENDS 

I was once someone like that. Thankfully, I had some good friends & co-workers that taught me more about fasion sense. This website will focus on the color aspect of outfits. Colors can communicate so much! Just like a picture can contain a thousand words, color can contain so much about a person’s personality.  

INTRO/EXAMPLE - Extrovert vs Introvert 

For example, vibrant colors can reflect a person’s energetic & bubbly attitude. However, a heavily introverted person might give off the wrong signal by wearing vibrant colors. More calming and relaxing colors might work better for an introverted person instead. Every situation is different, and we’re here to help you find out what works best for you!

        ------------------START OF PAGE 2---------------------------- 

NECESSARY INFORMATION: 

Some necessary information that users will need to know, but not provide, are their skin tones and their color preferences. A user must know how to properly identify their skin tone so that they may find colors that work best with them. Users must also know what their color preferences are. This is important, because their favorite colors will determine what other colors they can wear with that favorite color. 

 

WHY PEOPLE COME TO WEBSITE: 

All sorts of people will come to this website for many reasons. Some might be beginning to develop their fashion sense, and they might be looking for help on how to match the colors of their wardrobe. Some might be seeking to expand their wardrobe, and they might use this website to find out what colors they would like to see themselves wear. Others might be using this website as a tool to explain to a friend how important color choice is when it comes to picking out an outfit. Different colors can do many different things. Sometimes they can work for us, while other times they might work against us. One color might be used in a social setting to communicate that you’re an open person that likes to talk, while that same color in a more serious/professional social setting might not be inappropriate for the setting.

WHAT PEOPLE MIGHT ACCOMPLISH: 

People might want to accomplish the task of discovering and liking new color ways that they never thought they’d like or wear before. 

WE’LL SEE YA AGAIN. 

People will continue to come back to our site and use it often, because our site provides what others lack: Brutal Honesty. In order to progress in finding what works well with your skin tone and your color preferences, you must know what does not work well with your skin tone and your color preferences. That’s the simple truth. A color might look better on a person, while that same color might not look as great on another person. For example, a sky-blue colored T-shirt will look great on someone with a fair-skinned complexion. However, a sky-blue colored T-shirt will not look as good on someone with a darker skin tone. Earthly tones, like a dark forest-green color, will look great on someone with a darker skin tone, but it won’t look as good on a fair-skinned person.
