            WHAT PEOPLE MIGHT ACCOMPLISH: People might want to accomplish the task of discovering and liking new color ways that they never thought they’d like or wear before. 
            WE’LL SEE YA AGAIN. People will continue to come back to our site and use it often, because our site provides what others lack: Brutal Honesty. 
            In order to progress in finding what works well with your skin tone and your color preferences, you must know what does not work well with your skin tone and your color preferences. 
            That’s the simple truth. A color might look better on a person, while that same color might not look as great on another person. 
            For example, a sky-blue colored T-shirt will look great on someone with a fair-skinned complexion. However, a sky-blue colored T-shirt will not look as good on someone with a darker skin tone. 
            Earthly tones, like a dark forest-green color, will look great on someone with a darker skin tone, but it won’t look as good on a fair-skinned person.
