        <div id="must_know_page_introduction"> 
            NECESSARY INFORMATION: Some necessary information that users will need to know, but not provide, are their skin tones and their color preferences. A user must know how to properly identify their skin tone so that they may find colors that work best with them. 
            Users must also know what their color preferences are. This is important, because their favorite colors will determine what other colors they can wear with that favorite color. WHY PEOPLE COME TO WEBSITE: 
            All sorts of people will come to this website for many reasons. Some might be beginning to develop their fashion sense, and they might be looking for help on how to match the colors of their wardrobe. 
            Some might be seeking to expand their wardrobe, and they might use this website to find out what colors they would like to see themselves wear. 
            Others might be using this website as a tool to explain to a friend how important color choice is when it comes to picking out an outfit. 
            Different colors can do many different things. Sometimes they can work for us, while other times they might work against us. One color might be used in a social setting to communicate that you’re an open person that likes to talk, 
            while that same color in a more serious/professional social setting might not be inappropriate for the setting.
